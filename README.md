# STM32F7_discovery
Examples for the STM32F7 discovery board

This project aims at providing some examples of code for the STM32F7 discovery board (see http://www.st.com/stm32f7-discovery).
The examples have been developped using AC6 System Workbench (see http://www.openstm32.org/), and the corresponding project files are included.

The following examples are provided:
  - STM32F7_led_blink: This example shows how to make the green led blink
  - STM32F7_UART_test: This example shows how to configure and use the UART
